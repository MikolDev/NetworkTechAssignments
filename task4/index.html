        <h2>TCP protocol</h2>
        <p><b>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</b> is a connection-oriented Transport layer protocol. TCP lets a device reliably send a packet to another device on the same network or on a different network. TCP ensures that each packet is delivered, if at all possible, by establishing a connection with the receiving device and then sending the packets. If a packet doesn't arrive, TCP resends the packet. The connection is closed only after the packet has been successfully delivered or an unrecoverable error condition has occurred.</p>

        <h2>UDP protocol</h2>
        <p><b>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</b> is a connectionless Transport layer protocol used when the overhead of a connection isn't required. After UDP has placed a packet on the network (via the IP protocol), it forgets about it. UDP doesn't guarantee that the packet arrives at its destination. Most applications that use UDP simply wait for any replies expected as a result of packets sent via UDP. If a reply doesn't arrive within a certain period of time, the applicationeither sends the packet again or gives up.</p>
